# üßò FlexYoga
Welcome to the README file for the FlexYoga web application. This project aims to create a holistic and beautiful MERN stack website as an internship assignment of Flexmoney providing comprehensive information and services related to yoga, meditation, and wellness retreats. The website is developed using a blend of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, and React, with Vite serving as the streamlined development platform. I have also used Express for backend server and MongoDB as database to store all the details of user permanently. It is secured with Firebase authentication and authorization and the admission form is properly validated.

## üë®üèª‚Äçüíª My Approach
### My approach for this project was:

1. Create frontend of the website using html, css and reactjs.
   
2. Make the website responsive so that it does not get distorted in any device.
   
3. Create a user authentication and authorization to secure data.
   
4. Create Admission form to accept user's data and store them in database.
   
5. Create the backend of the form using nodejs, expressjs and mongoDB.
    
6. Do the basic validations as stated in the assignment.
    
7. Show a "Payment Successful" message when the user is registered.


### The basic validations which I did in the project are as follows:

1. Every input field should be filled by the user.
   
2. User name must not be empty.
   
3. Age field must be between 18 and 65 years.
   
4. Gender should must be specified by the user.
   
5. Contact number must consist of 10 digits.
    
6. Fees should be exactly equal to 500.
    
7. User must select a slot in order to make the payment.

## ‚ö° Technologies Used

### The following technologies is utilized in this project:

- HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) for structuring the content of the website.
- CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for styling and enhancing the visual appearance.
- JavaScript for implementing interactive features and dynamic functionality.
- Bootstrap for responsive design and layout.
- React for building interactive components and managing data.
- Vite (a React development environment) for efficient development workflow.
- SASS for advanced styling and customization.
- Node as JavaScript runtime environment and to perform server side operations.
- MongoDB as database management system to store and retrieve information.
